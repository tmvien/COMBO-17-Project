# COMBO-17 Project - Galaxies' Redshift Estimates
- Language: R 
- Supervised learning - regression problem:
  - The target variable is photometric estimates of redshift, a measure of distance from us to an object.
  - The predictors variables are mainly the measurements and errors of brightness of color bands of galaxies.
- The dataset can be found [here](https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets/COMBO17.html)
- For more information on the dataset, please referer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0403666.pdf)
